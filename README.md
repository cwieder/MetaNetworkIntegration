#  Network-Based Approaches for Integrating Metabolomics Data from Large-Scale Repositories

## Content

This repository contains the following demo notebooks:
- **COVID_metabolite_meta_network**: Workflow for creating a metabolite-level meta network using COVID studies from the MetaboLights repository
- **COVID_pathway_network**: Workflow for creating a pathway-level meta network using COVID studies from the MetaboLights repository and Reactome pathways
- **Multi_study_network**: Workflow for creating a metabolite-study bipartite network using selected studies from MetabolomicsWorkbench
- **Workbench_global_network**: Workflow for creating a global study-study network from MetabolomicsWorkbench

The `Studies` folder contains data for the COVID case study, originating from MetaboLights. Additional files required to run the notebooks are also provided. 

## Requirements
Code has been tested using Python 3.12 on a Windows/Linux/MacOS system. Dependencies are listed at the top of each notebook and are available via PyPI.
